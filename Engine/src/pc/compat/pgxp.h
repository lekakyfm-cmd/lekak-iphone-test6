#define MEMORIES_PC_PGXP_H
/* PGXP, precise geometry (currently disabled by the `pgxp` setting's range).
 * The implementation remains available for future use. The GTE's
 * perspective transform rounds a vertex to a whole console pixel and keeps
 * no depth with it, which makes polygons wobble as they move and their
 * textures bend. rtp() (gte.c) keeps where each vertex it projects really
 * falls on the screen and its depth beside its SXY entry
 * (Memories_GtePrecise).
 *
 * The game's model drawing (the HMD polygon drivers,
 * src/pc/overrides/model_polygon_drivers.c: the duel field and every
 * monster) is ours, so it hands those values on where it writes each vertex
 * word into a packet, keyed by that word's address (Pgxp_StoreAt). DrawOTag
 * (libgpu.c) collects every word of the frame with its address, and the
 * words that are a vertex written so carry the precise values on to the
 * OpenGL picture (soft_gpu.h, gl_picture.c), which draws polygons with them.
 *
 * Drawing we do not follow is looked up by value instead: rtp() also
 * records each vertex keyed by its screen word (x | y << 16), and a frame
 * word equal to one is taken as that vertex (Pgxp_Find). A word two
 * vertices of a frame round to with different precise values is left as it
 * is. Nothing the game or the software GPU sees changes. */
